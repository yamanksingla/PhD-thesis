	abstract     = {Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. There is a dearth of large annotated training datasets in the multimedia domain hindering the development of supervised learning models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. On the other hand, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question answering, and topic classification. To leverage such advanced techniques to bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing long videos to generate their descriptions in natural language, followed by performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on fifteen video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised baselines for video understanding. Furthermore, to alleviate a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science on persuasion strategy identification.}

By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

	abstract     = {Abstract Video storytelling aims to generate a successive and succinct paragraph composed of multiple sentences to describe the visual contents in a long video. The major difficulty with video storytelling is the conflict between complex visual semantics and concise textual description. Existing methods address this problem by applying different segmentation strategies to long videos. However, these methods ignore that some story-irrelevant visual contents could be considered as noises, so visual information in a long video is not always conducive to story generation. Therefore, we propose a novel video storytelling model based on gated video memorability filtering (GVMF), which generates high-quality textual descriptions by filtering out clips with lower memorability scores, where objects and characters appear less frequently. The reason for introducing video memorability prediction is that video clips with higher video memorability scores tend to have more characters and objects so tend to be noticed by annotators for writing sentences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our method, which achieves the new state-of-the-art results on Video Story dataset.}

	abstract     = {Large language models (LMs) are able to in-context learn{---}perform a new task via inference alone by conditioning on a few input-label pairs (demonstrations) and making predictions for new inputs. However, there has been little understanding of how the model learns and which aspects of the demonstrations contribute to end task performance. In this paper, we show that ground truth demonstrations are in fact not required{---}randomly replacing labels in the demonstrations barely hurts performance on a range of classification and multi-choce tasks, consistently over 12 different models including GPT-3. Instead, we find that other aspects of the demonstrations are the key drivers of endtask performance, including the fact that they provide a few examples of (1) the label space, (2) the distribution of the input text, and (3) the overall format of the sequence. Together, our analysis provides a new way of understanding how and why in-context learning works, while opening up new questions about how much can be learned from large language models through inference alone.}

It too has certain weaknesses which we discuss. We show that perplexity can also be applied to languages having no obvious statistical description, since an entropy‐maximizing probability assignment can be found for any finite‐state grammar.

First, it provides a broad evolutionary foundation for conceptualizing the domain of emotion as seen in animals and humans. Second, it provides a structural model which describes the interrelations among emotions. Third, it has demonstrated both theoretical and empirical relations among a number of derivative domains including personality traits, diagnoses, and ego defenses. Fourth, it has provided a theoretical rationale for the construction of tests and scales for the measurement of key dimensions within these various domains. Fifth, it has stimulated a good deal of empirical research using these tools and concepts. Finally, the theory provides useful insights into the relationships among emotions, adaptations, and evolution.}

The first is technical, i.e., "How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?" Second, the semantic problem, i.e., "How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?" Third, the effectiveness problem, i.e., "How effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way?" The first level is essentially an engineering one and in the first part of the book Shannon develops a mathematical theory of communication. Weaver discusses the significance of this theory to the other two levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}
