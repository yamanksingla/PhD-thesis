By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

	abstract     = {Abstract Video storytelling aims to generate a successive and succinct paragraph composed of multiple sentences to describe the visual contents in a long video. The major difficulty with video storytelling is the conflict between complex visual semantics and concise textual description. Existing methods address this problem by applying different segmentation strategies to long videos. However, these methods ignore that some story-irrelevant visual contents could be considered as noises, so visual information in a long video is not always conducive to story generation. Therefore, we propose a novel video storytelling model based on gated video memorability filtering (GVMF), which generates high-quality textual descriptions by filtering out clips with lower memorability scores, where objects and characters appear less frequently. The reason for introducing video memorability prediction is that video clips with higher video memorability scores tend to have more characters and objects so tend to be noticed by annotators for writing sentences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our method, which achieves the new state-of-the-art results on Video Story dataset.}

First, it provides a broad evolutionary foundation for conceptualizing the domain of emotion as seen in animals and humans. Second, it provides a structural model which describes the interrelations among emotions. Third, it has demonstrated both theoretical and empirical relations among a number of derivative domains including personality traits, diagnoses, and ego defenses. Fourth, it has provided a theoretical rationale for the construction of tests and scales for the measurement of key dimensions within these various domains. Fifth, it has stimulated a good deal of empirical research using these tools and concepts. Finally, the theory provides useful insights into the relationships among emotions, adaptations, and evolution.}

The first is technical, i.e., "How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?" Second, the semantic problem, i.e., "How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?" Third, the effectiveness problem, i.e., "How effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way?" The first level is essentially an engineering one and in the first part of the book Shannon develops a mathematical theory of communication. Weaver discusses the significance of this theory to the other two levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}
